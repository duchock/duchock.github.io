            <h2>Alabama</h2>
            <br>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://birmingham.lockedin.com/">Locked In Birmingham</a> - The Classroom - 2016 - Our first escape room together (along with some college friends).</p>
            <br>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://breakoutgames.com/birmingham">Breakout Games Birmingham</a> - 2018 - The rooms that started the trend. We did about 8 rooms at this location with a 
            rotating cast of friends, family and strangers.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Colorado</h2>
            <br>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://denver.puzzleeffect.com/">Puzzle Effect Denver</a> - Knight & Rook & R.E.S.C.U.E. - 2019 - During a destination wedding trip, we stopped in for a quick escape with a few hours before my flight.  
                We had only planned on one, but were convinced to do another.  My shin still hurts.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Connecticut</h2>
            <br>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://laraslabyrinth.com/">Lara's Labyrinth CT</a> - Dragonborne & Curse of Osiris - 2020 - A quaint stop on our Northeastern road trip.  Another place where we were convinced to do another unplanned room after the first.</p>

            <h2>Delaware</h2>
            <br>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://middletown.novusescaperoom.com/">Novus Escape Games Middletown</a> - The Testament of Tesla - 2021 - A chain imported from Malaysia, this highly stylized group of rooms offered two things we hadn't seen before: roles and fully automated computer guidance.  A game master in theory would help, but generally the computer terminal provided timekeeping and any clue giving.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Georgia</h2>
            <br>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://escapetheroom.com/atlanta/">Escape The Room Atlanta</a> - The Rec Room & The Newsroom - 2018 & 2019 - As long as we're at Dragoncon, we might as well get in another escape room.</p>

            <br>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.charmcityclueroom.com/">Charm City Clue Room</a> - Dark Carnival - 2021 - Unfortunately, we didn't escape in enough time to get a table at the Hard Rock Cafe.</p>

            <br>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://breakoutgames.com/boston">Breakout Games Boston (Woburn)</a> - Hostage - 2020 - At this point we have probably done all of the current Breakout games.</p>          
            <br>
            <h2>New Jersey</h2>
            <br>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloakanddaggerescaperooms.com/">Cloak & Dagger</a> - Crime Scene - 2021 - A deceptively high quality (though not the best designed) room.  The only one (as of 2022) we didn't escape.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>New York</h2>
            <br>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://missionescapegames.com/nyc">Mission Escape Games NYC</a> - Escape The Nemesis - 2018 - This was a great room made even better by being paired with a family whos kid was having a birthday.  I'm not one for kids, but it was endearing.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Rhode Island</h2>
            <br>
            <p>RI Curiosity Shop - Ewan Watarmy's Bunker - 2020 - This was adorable.  Clearly a simple operation, but had a lot of local charm.  It was enough to convince me to slow down and forget about getting back in time for my BWL raid.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Tennessee</h2>
            <br>

It could be the infrequent alcohol use, but for some reason I just contribute nothing to the birthday escape rooms.  There were 6 of us for this one, and most things were solved by the time I turned around.  Some cute puzzles and always love local flavor in my escapes.</p>
            <br>

            <br>

            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://insomniaescaperoomdc.com/">Insomnia Escape Room DC</a> - The Mafia - 2021 - Very simple room.  Yes, DC does count as a state.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>West Virginia</h2>
            <br>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://morgantownescaperoom.com/">Morgantown Escape Room</a> - Time Chasers - 2021 - A room with a very interesting mechanic to it.  We technically escaped.</p>
